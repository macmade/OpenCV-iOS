Overview
--------

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions for real time computer vision.
This project is a port of the OpenCV library for Apple iOS. It includes two XCode projects: one for iPhone, the other one for iPad.

OpenCV is released under the BSD License, it is free for both academic and commercial use.

The official OpenCV documentation can be found at the following address:
http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/

Please read the [documentation][1] to learn how to start developing iPhone and iPad applications powered by OpenCV, or start developing your applications now by [downloading][2] the XCode project files.

You can use the XCode project files freely.
Note that you still need to give credits to OpenCV, as stated by the BSD License.
That said, we'll be very happy if you drop us a line when releasing your app!
